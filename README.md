Disk Scheduler Simulation
This project simulates various disk scheduling algorithms and allows users to analyze their performance.

Overview
The project includes implementations of the following disk scheduling algorithms:

Elevator
First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
Users can either provide their own data or generate random data for simulation. The simulation results are displayed and can also be saved for further analysis.

Features
Manual Input: Users can input their own disk scheduling data.
Random Data Generator: Users can generate random disk scheduling data for simulation.
Elevator Algorithm: Simulates the Elevator disk scheduling algorithm.
FCFS Algorithm: Simulates the First-Come-First-Served disk scheduling algorithm.
Simulation Results: Displays simulation results for analysis.
